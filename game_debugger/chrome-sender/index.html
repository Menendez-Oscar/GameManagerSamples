      <h3>
        Instructions:
      </h3>
      <li>Make sure you have the Google cast extension installed.</li>
      <li>Cast this tab to the Cast device.</li>
      <li>
        Open chrome dev console by pressing <span class="code-key">F12</span> on
        a PC and <span class="code-key">Cmd</span> +
        <span class="code-key">Opt</span> + <span class="code-key">I</span> on
        a Mac for additional commands.
      </li>

      <h3>
        How does this work?
      </h3>
      <p>
        After opening the chrome dev console, you will see a list of available
        commands that can be used to control the app. As you change the game
        states through the dev console, the changes will be reflected on the
        receiver, and you will be able to see the result of the commands live.
      </p>
      <p>
        As an example, try connecting a new player to the game. We can do this
        by entering this into the dev console:
        <span class="code">sendPlayerAvailable('myPlayerId', null)</span>.
        Note that you don't have to provide a player name to send a players
        available request. When you leave the <span class="code">playerId</span>
        blank, the game will automatically generate a player name and attach it
        to your sender. If there is already a playerId associated with your
        sender device, then leaving the playerId field blank will assume the
        ID of the already associated player.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can also provide extra messages to go along with your requests. For
        example, if your player named 'John' wants to join the game but wants to
        skip directly to level 5, you could send something along the lines of
        <span class="code">sendPlayerAvailable('John', {skipToLevel : 5})</span>
        to reflect this.
      </p>
      <p>
        Senders can request data from the receiver about the current game state.
        They can also respond to events fired from the receiver, even from
        other plays on other sender devices!  To request a snapshot of the
        current game state, you can call
        <span class="code">gameManagerClient.getCurrentState();</span>
        which returns an object representing the current game state.
        Note that in this demo we store our instance of the
        <span class="code">GameManagerClient</span>
        in a global variable called <span class="code">gameManagerClient</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are other commands you can try out by opening the chrome dev
        console.
